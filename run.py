# Runner will call this so Runner only knows that first param is context and second is agent and thats it if change the order so things will still work but be mindfull of the outcomes
# if i dont pass context and also not use it in return so its ok
# it can work with any DT bcz evrything is obj but to mk our life easy we create a class so we can get 
#   1) structure Data if we are getting some data from api/dp etc 
#   2) easy access to type hints
